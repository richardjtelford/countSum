Community and assemblage data are unfortunately often presented as percentages rather than the original counts. Since the count sum is an important quality control diagnostic, it is useful be able to estimate it. The `countSum` package estimates the count sum for percentage data.

A discussion of the method can be found in a preprint at https://github.com/richardjtelford/count.check.ms

## Installation

You can install the development version of `countSum` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
